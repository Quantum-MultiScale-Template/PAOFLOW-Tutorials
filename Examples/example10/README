Transport properties of GaAs with energy and temperature dependent models for the relaxation time, tau. The interpolated k-mesh should be made finer to achieve convergence. To facilitate memory capacity of typical machines and ensure a reasonable runtime, in this example the mesh is turned down to 40x40x40.

main.py:
* Build the PAO Hamiltonian.
* Interpolate to a finer k-mesh.
* Compute the eigenvalues, gradient, and momenta.
* Compute the chemical potential for a range of temperatures at the specified doping concentration.
* Define a user-defined tau model.
* Calculate the transport properties with a combination of built-in and user-defined models for tau.
